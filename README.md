# Email notification library using phpMailer  This library has the function to send email using the phpmailer library. Doing this action in an uncomplicated way is essential for any system.  To install the library, run the following command:  ```sh composer requires gustavoweb/composer_teste ```  To make use of the library, just request composer's autoload, invoke the class and call the method:  ```sh <?php  requires __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';  USE Notification\Email;  $email = new Email(2, "mail.host.com", "your@email.com", "your password", "secure smtp (tls/ssl)", "port (587)",     "from@email.com", "From name");  $email->sendEmail("SUbject", "Content", "reply@email.com", "Replay Name", "address@email.com", "Address Name"); ```  Note that the entire configuration of sending the email is using the magic constructor method! Once the developer's method is invoked within your application, your system will be able to train the triggers.  ### Developers * [Gustavo Web] - Developer of this library and tutor of the Composer na Practical course! * [Robson V.
